# Build a CineBot with Snowflake Native Apps and Snowflake Cortex

I attended [Snowflake's BUILD 2024](https://www.snowflake.com/build/) conference for developers and data scientists. It focused on making use of enterprise data.

Enterprise data is often stored in different places, unorganized, inaccessible, or worse yet, stashed in a spreadsheet owned by a single team. Valuable information sits unused because employees don’t know it exists or they can’t figure out how to make use of it.

Snowflake’s Enterprise Data Warehouse acts as a central hub for all of an organization’s data. It can store structured and semi-structured data in Snowflake’s Data Cloud.

Snowflake allows organizations to chat with its data using its Cortex functionality. Cortex is Snowflake's AI and ML framework. Cortex Search, the feature within the Cortex tool, uses semantic lookup and vector search to power an AI-driven chat interface.

An organization can build a chat application using Snowflake Native Apps. The application can be used privately or externally. A Snowflake Native App can run securely within a customer’s Snowflake account or the Snowflake Native App can be made publicly available through the Snowflake Marketplace.

I see use cases for this technology frequently. When I worked for Colorado’s Department of Public Health and Environment, I wanted to store public data about health and environment in Snowflake and chat with it to ask questions like:

- How has air quality in Larimer County affected asthma cases since the Alexander Mountain Fire?
- What was the cancer rate in counties that surround the Rocky Flats Plant prior to EPA cleanup efforts and what is the cancer rate now?
- What is the most frequent injury for children in Colorado's cities compared to injuries in rural areas?

The [Build a CineBot with Snowflake Native Apps and Snowflake Cortex project](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/build-a-cinebot-with-snowflake-native-apps-and-cortex/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) is a good starting point and learning exercise.

Snowflake has a public AWS S3 bucket with [movie data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehmetisik/movies-metadata) from a dataset provided by Kaggle. The lab demonstrates how to load the data from AWS into Snowflake and then query the dataset in natural language using Cortex Search. Streamlit is used to provide a user-friendly UI.

I tried working through the lab using just the Quickstart Guide, but found some parts unclear. Following along with the recording gave me a much deeper understanding. In this blog, I’ll share what I learned and provide a step-by-step guide to setting up the project.

---

### Step 1

Follow the Overview Section of the [Quickstart Guide](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/build-a-cinebot-with-snowflake-native-apps-and-cortex/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0), set up your free account and clone the [repo](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-build-chatbot-with-snowflake-native-app-snowflake-cortex), and sign up for a trial account and clone the repo.

### Step 2

The Snowflake interface shown in the picture below is called “Snowsight.” Click the Projects icon, represented by a command prompt symbol, in the left navigation bar. Then click on the plus sign in the top right and select SQL worksheet. A tab within Snowsight will open. The tab will have the date. Click the three dots to the right of the date and rename it to Cine_bot lab.

### Step 3

A worksheet in Snowsight is an interactive environment where users can write, execute, and manage SQL or Python queries to interact with Snowflake data and applications. Click on the worksheets tab, and you should see a blank worksheet with the name of Cine_bot lab and the role of ACCOUNTADMIN selected.

### Step 4

Find the repo that you cloned and find the file called `lab_setup.sql` in the `scripts` folder. Copy the file and paste it into the blank project. Select/highlight the first line that says `use role accountadmin;` and click the blue button with the arrow icon to execute the line. There will be a message at the bottom of the worksheet that says “Statement Executed Successfully.”

### Step 5

Now the next set of lines can be run as shown in the Native App Provider Setup section of the Quickstart guide.

```sql
create role if not exists nactx_role;

grant role nactx_role to role accountadmin;

grant create warehouse on account to role nactx_role;

grant create database on account to role nactx_role;

grant create application package on account to role nactx_role;

grant create application on account to role nactx_role with grant option;
```

### 6. Install & Run Application

#### Overview
To simulate the app consumer experience, we will create a role called `nac` and grant it the necessary privileges required to create applications as well as set up a database to house the data we’ll be querying with our Snowflake Native App.

#### Install App as the Consumer
```sql
use role nac;
create application cortex_app_instance from application package cortex_app_pkg using version v1;
```

#### Grant the Application Privileges on the Movies Table
```sql
grant all on database movies to application cortex_app_instance;
grant all on schema movies.data to application cortex_app_instance;
grant all on table movies.data.movies_raw to application cortex_app_instance;
grant usage on warehouse wh_nac to application cortex_app_instance;
```

#### Grant the Application IMPORTED PRIVILEGES which allows it to use Cortex Functions
```sql
use role accountadmin;
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO APPLICATION cortex_app_instance;
```

#### Call the Supplied Stored Procedures to Process the Movies Data and Build the Cortex Search Service
```sql
use role nac;
call cortex_app_instance.CORE.TABLE_CHUNKER();
call cortex_app_instance.CORE.CREATE_CORTEX_SEARCH();
```

At this point, you can navigate to the application by clicking on "Data Products" on the left side of the Snowsight screen and then by clicking on "Apps." You can click on the `Cortex_App_Instance` application, and it will bring up the chatbot where you can ask it to recommend movies.

### Step 22: Deploy and Test the Streamlit App

1. **Switch to the Consumer Role:**  
   To proceed, ensure you are operating under the `nac` role by executing:
   ```sql
   use role nac;
   ```

2. **Launch the Streamlit App from Snowsight:**  
   Navigate to the "Data Products" section in Snowsight (left-hand navigation menu) and select "Apps." You should see your `cortex_app_instance` listed as an installed application.

3. **Start the Streamlit App:**  
   - Select the application and choose a warehouse (`wh_nac`) to execute it. 
   - This will launch the Streamlit-based UI.

4. **Interact with the App:**  
   The Streamlit interface allows users to query the movie database using natural language. For example:
   - Enter queries like: *"Recommend five movies similar to 'The Shawshank Redemption'"*.
   - The app will process your query using Snowflake Cortex's retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities and display contextual movie recommendations.

Now your Streamlit application is fully functional and you can ask things like "Please return movies that aren't a bummer and the dog doesn't die at the end."
